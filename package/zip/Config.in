	  zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix,
	  VMS, MSDOS, OS/2, Windows 9x/NT/XP, Minix, Atari, Macintosh,
	  MVS, z/OS, Amiga, Acorn RISC, and other OS.
	  It is analogous to a combination of the Unix commands tar(1)
	  and compress(1) (or tar(1) and gzip(1)) and is compatible
	  with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems) and other
	  major zip utilities.
